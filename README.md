A demonstration of Docker to implement a simple 3 tier architecture

* frontend will be able to access the mid-tier
* mid-tier will be able to access the db

In order to run this in docker, simply type ```docker-compose up``` at the command prompt. Docker will then create the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) from the stock [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) image. The api uses [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) with [express](http://expressjs.com/) and is built from a [node:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) image. The front end uses [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and built from a [node:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) image.






Here's a GitHub Actions workflow that builds both the frontend (React app) and backend (Node.js/Express app) of your application, then pushes the combined image to the DigitalOcean Container Registry.

1.Docker file of frontend 
2.Dockerfile of backend

in below steps we combine both docker files in a third docker file which will be present in the root directory of the application and the create a ci.yml file in workflows to execute both backend and frontend in one image and then push it of container registry on digitalocean 

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file named `ci.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository and add the following code:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Combined Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Change this to your main branch if different

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Log in to DigitalOcean Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: registry.digitalocean.com
          username: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t registry.digitalocean.com/your-digitalocean-username/your-app-name:latest .

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker push registry.digitalocean.com/your-digitalocean-username/your-app-name:latest
```

### Explanation:
1. **Triggers:** The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch.
2. **Jobs:**
   - **Checkout:** Retrieves your repository code.
   - **Docker Buildx:** Sets up Docker Buildx for building multi-platform images (if needed).
   - **Login:** Authenticates with the DigitalOcean Container Registry using GitHub secrets.
   - **Build Docker Image:** Builds the Docker image from the `Dockerfile` in the root of your project.
   - **Push Docker Image:** Pushes the built image to the DigitalOcean Container Registry.

### Setup Secrets:
In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add the following secrets:
- `DIGITALOCEAN_USERNAME`: Your DigitalOcean username.
- `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: A personal access token with read/write permissions for your container registry.

### Dockerfile Example

Make sure you have a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project that combines the frontend and backend. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Frontend
FROM node:16 AS frontend-build

WORKDIR /app/frontend

COPY frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY frontend/ .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Build Backend
FROM node:16 AS backend-build

WORKDIR /app/backend

COPY backend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY backend/ .

# Copy built frontend files to backend
COPY --from=frontend-build /app/frontend/build ./public

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]  # Adjust this as necessary for your main server file
```

### Final Notes:
- Replace `your-digitalocean-username` and `your-app-name` with your actual DigitalOcean username and the name you want for your application in the container registry.
- Ensure your backend is configured to serve the static files from the `public` directory (where the React build files are copied).
- Adjust any other paths and configurations according to your project structure.
